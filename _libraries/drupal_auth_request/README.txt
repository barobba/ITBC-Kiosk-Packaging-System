Here is a way to get LiveAndTell content that is private. This might be used in the background for an organization to access private content behind their servers. For now, it's using session key authentication.

Maybe it would be better to use OAuth authentication for scaling up. (I would have, but I had problems getting Drupal OAuth module to work the LiveAndTell website [11/10/2011].)
