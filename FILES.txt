SUMMARY

  Here is how the programs that kept in the list of files below work
  together.

  The main file retrieval program is here:
  (File "kiosk_content_retrieval")

    The main file retrieval program does the following:
    
    1. First, the system checks for which nodes to retrieve.
       (File "endpoints/selected-nodes")

    2. Then, the system calls for the data, via a caching system.
       (File "endpoints_caching")
       
          A. The caching system calls local and remote endpoints, and
             returns a cached copy of the data.
             
             (File "endpoints/picture-books/")
             (File "endpoints/songs/")
             (URL http://liveandtell.com/api/kiosk/0.1/.../json/[nids])
             
    3. Finally, the system retrieves the referenced media and performs any
       file conversions or file processing needed.
